	Once upon a time I was a child, at church, and next to the church they had livestock separated by a dinky little metal fence. Well after boring church, I ran up to the fence, and grabbed a massive chunk of grass to feed to the goat, who sniffed my hand then looked away. I didn't get why he wasn't interested, then I looked down to see a veritable sea of fire ants pourind down my arm, I had grabbed their entire anthill to feed to this goat. My mom rushed me home and threw me in the shower. lol. I was ok, but talk about stress.
